    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This recipe shows you how to cook a perfectly seasoned sirloin steak topped with rich garlic butter. The butter melts over the hot steak, creating an incredibly flavorful and tender meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
        <li>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
